The repository contains the link to source codes required for running the simulator and instructions how to install and run it.

Link of the source code: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B3wnla-WHMXiTWpEMGJGUGJKdkU?usp=sharing

Installation Instructions:

1) Download the source code of simplesim3 from http://www.simplescalar.com/agreement.php3?simplesim-3v0e.tgz

2) Make a directory called "simplescalar" in your local machine.

3) Within that make a directory called "build" where you have to place the source codes.

4) Place the "example" directory in "simplescalar" directory outside build.

5) Simplescalar is incompatible with current systems. So, to make it work, follow the technique found out by Sebastian which he has posted on Github: https://github.com/sebastian2696/SimpleScalarUbuntu. All credits to Sebastian to help you traverse the road.
