# Simplescalar
The repository contains the link to source codes required for running the simulator and instructions how to install and run it.

Installation Instructions:

1) Download the source code of simplesim3 from http://www.simplescalar.com/agreement.php3?simplesim-3v0e.tgz

2) Make a directory called "simplescalar" in your local machine.

3) Simplescalar is incompatible with current systems. So, to make it work, follow the technique found out by Sebastian which he has posted on Github: https://github.com/sebastian2696/SimpleScalarUbuntu. You can clone this in your local machine.

4) Within the directory "build", you have to place the source code.

5) Now, outside build directory, you have to execute the script: ./installscript_32.sh

6) After running the script, run this: source ~/.bashrc
